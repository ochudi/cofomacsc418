My repository for CSC 418 - Special Topics in Computer Science!

This repository contains weekly practice and project codes for the course. The content is primarily in Jupyter Notebook format (.ipynb), and the repository is segmented into weeks as the course progresses (e.g., week-1, week-2, etc.). Each week's directory includes both practice exercises and projects, all organized in the same format for ease of navigation and understanding.

## Directory Structure

- **week-1**: Contains practice exercises and projects for week 1.
- **week-2**: Contains practice exercises and projects for week 2.
- ...
- **week-n**: Contains practice exercises and projects for week n.

## Other Learnings

In addition to weekly practice and projects, this repository may also include supplementary materials, resources, and other learnings relevant to CSC 418.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements, suggestions, or additional resources to share, feel free to submit a pull request... but for the next 14 weeks - contributions should be exclusive to Desmond Moru, PhD.
